110. Balanced Binary Tree
A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: true
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104



complexity : 
time complexity is O(n) -- no of nodes n , we end up going to all the nodes once.
space complexity is O(h), i.e. O(n) in the worst case and O(log n) for a balanced tree
