Count Substring
Given string s consisting only a,b,c. return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b, and c.

Example 1:

Input:
abcabc
Output:
10
Explanation:
The required substrings  are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc",
"bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc".

Example 2:

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraint:
3<=s.length<=5 x 104  
S only contains a,b,c.
