Given an array nums and an integer k.Return the number of non-empty subsequences of nums such that the sum of all elements in the subsequence is equal to k.


Examples:
Input : nums = [4, 9, 2, 5, 1] , k = 10

Output : 2

Explanation : The possible subsets with sum k are [9, 1] , [4, 5, 1].

Input : nums = [4, 2, 10, 5, 1, 3] , k = 5

Output : 3

Explanation : The possible subsets with sum k are [4, 1] , [2, 3] , [5].


Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 20
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= k <= 2000

Time and Space Complexity Analysis of Recursive Subsequence Sum Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Function:
---------
The recursive function funo tries all subsequences of the given array to find how many have a sum equal to the target 'k'. At each index, it explores two possibilities:
- Include the current element.
- Exclude the current element.

Code:
-----
void funo(vector<int>& nums, int k, int i, int sum) {
    if (i == nums.size()) {
        if (sum == k) count++;
        return;
    }

    funo(nums, k, i + 1, sum + nums[i]); // include nums[i]
    funo(nums, k, i + 1, sum);           // exclude nums[i]
}

Time Complexity:
----------------
At each index 'i', the function makes two recursive calls: one for including nums[i], one for excluding it. So the total number of recursive calls grows exponentially.

- For 'n' elements, the total number of calls is 2^n.
- Each call does O(1) work (just parameter passing and condition checking).
- Therefore, the total time complexity is:

    O(2^n)

Explanation:
------------
Each element in the array has two choices (include or exclude), leading to 2^n possible subsets. Every subset is checked once.

Example:
---------
If nums = {4, 9, 2, 5, 1} â†’ n = 5
Total subsets = 2^5 = 32

Space Complexity:
-----------------
The space complexity depends on the recursion call stack.

- The maximum depth of the recursion tree is 'n' (we go from index 0 to index n).
- No additional memory (like arrays or hash maps) is used.
- Therefore, the space complexity is:

    O(n)

Summary:
---------
| Aspect         | Complexity |
|----------------|------------|
| Time           | O(2^n)     |
| Space          | O(n)       |
