palindrome : A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
131. Palindrome Partitioning

Given a string s, partition s such that every
of the partition is a

. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]

Example 2:

Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 16
    s contains only lowercase English letters.
