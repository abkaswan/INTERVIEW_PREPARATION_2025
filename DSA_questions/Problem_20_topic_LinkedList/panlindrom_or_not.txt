234. Palindrome Linked List
Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.
A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
 

Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?


Method 1 ; use a stack but it takes O(n) time and O(n) space
Method 2 : think how you can do it in O(n) time and O(1) space -- means in-place in the same LinkedList
