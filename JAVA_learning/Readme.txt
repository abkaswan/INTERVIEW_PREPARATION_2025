Ok the main file is Main.java , here you can see the format like this for each segment: 
// logical operator
// LogicalOperators logicalOperators = new LogicalOperators();
// logicalOperators.check();

now to run this uncomment it and run it , like this : 
// logical operator
LogicalOperators logicalOperators = new LogicalOperators();
logicalOperators.check();

Another thing to note is that the Object oriented Concepts are in file called OopsIntro.java , You can run it in the same way :
// OOPs - OBJECT ORIENTED Programming
// OopsIntro oopsIntro = new OopsIntro();
// oopsIntro.run();


follow this youtube video line by line , i have written all the code that was inside it.
